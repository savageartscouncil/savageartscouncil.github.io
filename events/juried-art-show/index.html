                        <p>For ten fabulous years, the volunteers of the Savage Arts Council have hosted the Savage Juried Art Competition and Show. Thank you to all the volunteers, hosts in the community, our sponsors, the artists, and all of the patrons of the arts who have supported this show.</p>
                        <p>This year, we are re-visioning the mission and programming of the Savage Arts Council. We are in the process of adding new classes and events, and imagining a new signature event for 2018. To this end, we will be taking a hiatus from holding the Juried Art Show in 2017.</p>
                        <p>Stay tuned for new and exciting projects throughout the year! You can receive updates on our Facebook page, our Instagram account, or here on our website. </p>
                        <p>If you are an arts enthusiast, or are an artist yourself, we'd love to have you become a member of the Savage Arts Council. You can participate as little or as much as you'd like! A person could become a member, which means you can attend meetings if you'd like, or join planning committees, or even make suggestions for classes or projects you'd like to lead. You could also become a board member if you are interested! Every voice in the community matters, and we'd love have your voice join in on our discussions as we plan fun and interesting arts events for all. Drop us a line if you have any questions! We can be reached at <a href="mailto:info@savageartscouncil.org">info@savageartscouncil.org</a>.</p>
