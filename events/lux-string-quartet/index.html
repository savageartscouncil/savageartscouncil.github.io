<p>On Sunday February 21st, 2016, we had the privilege of hosting an afternoon of music by composer Heath Mathews at the Savage Arts and Cultural Center. Admission was free.</p>

<p><img alt="Lux String Quartet" class="in-content-image" src="/sites/default/files/site-attachments/images/luxquartet.jpg" />Lux String Quartet, pianist Stephen Self and composer Heath Mathews presented a concert of new music. Members of Lux and Dr. Self premiered Mathews' Outdoor Scenes, a new work for piano trio, along with other selections from the composer’s catalog. Additionally, the renowned Lux String Quartet performed Prokofiev's stunning second quartet. The concert included a discussion of the compositions and a reception followed the event.</p>

<p>Heath Mathews is a fiscal year 2015 recipient of an Artist Initiative grant from the Minnesota State Arts Board. This activity was made possible by the voters of Minnesota through a grant from the Minnesota State Arts Board, thanks to a legislative appropriation by the Minnesota State Legislature; and by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. </p>

<h3>Erika Blanco, violin</h3>

<p>A Southerner from the coast of South Carolina by birthright and Midwesterner by recent transplant, Erika holds a bachelor’s degree in violin performance from Vanderbilt University and a master’s degree in violin performance and Suzuki pedagogy from the University of Minnesota. She studied under the late Stephen Panchaud, assistant concertmaster of the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera, before transferring to Vanderbilt’s Blair School of Music under Blair String Quartet first violinist Christian Teal. &nbsp;Most recently, she - herself a product of Shinichi Suzuki's Mother Tongue philosophy and talent education movement, has studied at the University of Minnesota with Suzuki pioneer Mark Bjork. She is Suzuki violin-registered in volumes 1-10 in addition to enrichment courses; her trainers include Carol Smith, Ronda Cole, Kimberly Meier-Sims, Mary Cay Neal, Nancy Lokken, Brian Lewis, Kathy Wood, Nancy Jackson, and of course, Mark Bjork. Though trained classically, Erika enjoys jammin’, stompin’, and shakin’ in any setting: homegrown folk, fiddlin’, rockin’-and-a-rollin’, salsa, and the new music scene.</p>

<p>Aside from Lux, Erika performs in the Quad City Symphony Orchestra's first violin section and Twin Cities-based salsa group Charanga Tropical and maintains a teaching studio at home and with Augsburg College Suzuki Talent Education. Professionally, her passion is to nurture an appreciation for beauty, collaboration, and the learning process, and personally, to be spurred on by great musicians and colleagues and to participate in the transcendental euphoria of chamber music. Erika delights in playing her commissioned 2012 Kurt Widenhouse violin.</p>

<h3>Sam Rudy, violin</h3>

<p>Sam Rudy earned his master's degree in Music Theory from the University of Minnesota. Since then he has been active as a teacher and performer of orchestral, solo, and chamber music across the Midwest. He has served as concertmaster of Orchestra Iowa and the Mankato Symphony Orchestra, as well as holding posts with the Quad Cities, Waterloo-Cedar Falls, and La Crosse Symphony Orchestras.

As a founding member of both Lux String Quartet and Enkidu string quartet, he has worked with professional as well as student composers to perform new works at the Cedar Cultural Center, University of Minnesota, and the New Horizons Music Festival, including performance in a masterclass for internationally renowned Stanford composer Brian Ferneyhough.</p>

<p>Rudy has attended several summer festivals, including the National Orchestral Institute Symphony Orchestra Academy of the Pacific, and is a co-founder of the Oskaloosa Chamber Music Festival in Oskaloosa, Iowa.

<h3>Benjamin Davis, viola</h3>

<p>Benjamin Davis is a Twin Cities based performer, teacher and administrator who has had the privilege of receiving instruction from Korey Konkol, Thomas Turner, Carol Rodland, Roland Vamos, Jonathan Sturm, Charles Miranda and Bruce McLellan. &nbsp;In addition to a full studio of young violists and violinists, he is a member of the Quad City Symphony and substitute violist for Orchestra Iowa, Des Moines Symphony, South Dakota Symphony and principal substitute for the Mankato Symphony. &nbsp;As an avid chamber and solo musician, Davis frequently performs works in musical styles ranging from Baroque, rock, Irish fiddle to today's avant-garde. &nbsp;He regularly premieres new works for small ensemble and solo viola. &nbsp;This love of new music stems from his passion for the creative process that was cultivated while studying new music with James Dillon and Noriko Kawai at the University Minnesota. &nbsp;Most recently, this resulted in the premiere of 6 new works written for Lux String Quartet that were performed in concert and in masterclass with Brian Ferneyhough. &nbsp;The Contemporary Music Workshop at "The U" allowed him the opportunity to work directly with the Arditti Quartet, Quatuor Diotima and JACK Quartet.</p>

<p>As an administrator, Davis is the Founder and Artistic Director of the Oskaloosa Chamber Music Festival (OCMF), hosted annually in Oskaloosa, Iowa. &nbsp;OCMF is preparing for its sixth consecutive season. &nbsp;From 2011-12, Davis organized chamber music events for Classical Revolution Twin Cities whose focus was to put chamber music in cafes, bars and other non-traditional, community focused spaces. &nbsp;Currently, he serves as the President of the Minnesota Viola Society. &nbsp;He proudly performs on a 16 3/8" award-winning viola modeled after da Salo and crafted by New York-based luthier Jason Viseltear.</p>

<h3>Lars Krogstad Ortiz, cello</h3>
