      <h1>Artist Directory Submissions</h1>
      <p>Directory submissions are accepted year-round, and participation in the Directory is free of charge for Savage Art Council members. If you are not a member and would like to join, please hop on over to our <a href="/council/membership">Membership page</a>!</p>
      <p>Participation in the Artists Directory provides the following benefits:</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>Promotion for the artist.</li>
      	<li>The opportunity to be featured as the “Artist of the Month” on the Savage Arts Council Facebook page.</li>
      	<li>The ability for artists to showcase an image of their work in a unique online gallery. Artists can include their contact information, including website and/or email, in order for art enthusiasts to reach the artist with inquiries.&nbsp;</li>
      	<li>Networking with other artists – it’s fun to see who else is out there, when creating can be such a solitary process!</li>
      </ol>
