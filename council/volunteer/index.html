                    <p>Savage Arts Council is a volunteer-led 501(c)(3) non-profit that presents a number of art programs in Savage and throughout Scott County, MN. We focus our energies on programs, events and activities for greater Minneapolis/St. Paul art patrons and area artists. &nbsp;We develop, manage and support a variety of art programs each year and present two major art events: Savage Juried Show &amp; Competition and Scott County Art Crawl.</p>

                    <p>We have needs for several types of volunteers. If you are interested in any of these volunteer opportunities, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@SavageArtsCouncil.org">info@SavageArtsCouncil.org</a>. We’d love to have you on board!&nbsp;Some examples are:</p>
