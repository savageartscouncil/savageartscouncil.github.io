<p>The Savage Arts Council, a 501.c.3 non-profit, was founded in 2006 for the purpose of adding cultural art events to the growing south metro region, and to building art appreciation and support for regional artists. We are a volunteer-led, community based arts organization that supports art programs in Savage and the South/Southwest Twin Cities metropolitan market. We have launched, funded and/or managed multiple new fine art events that help bring artists and art appreciators together, with two annual signature events that have expanded each year, the Scott County Art Crawl, founded 2010, and the Savage Juried Art Show &amp; Competition, founded 2006.</p>

<p><img alt="Flow of Love | Rick Mittelstadt" class="in-content-image is-portrait" src="/sites/default/files/site-attachments/images/FLOW%20OF%20LOVE.jpg">The Savage Arts Council has also developed and supported numerous art programs throughout our history.</p>
